## What is it?
This is a simple calculator I made to calculate gear ratios of oval bicycle chainrings.

## Why oval?
The benefit of oval chainrings is that they **increase** the gear ratio (ie make it harder to pedal) on the downstroke when your legs are producing the most power, and **decrease** the gear ratio (ie make it easier to pedal) when the pedals are near the top/bottom and producing very little power.

In short, oval chainrings offer riders *continuously variable gearing*, based on what position the pedals are in. This helps your power output be more consistant, rather than producing "surges" of power on the downstroke.

## Chainring shape
Not all non-circular chainrings are made the same. Most are ovals (technically *ellipses*), but some are odd looking rounded-rectangles. The Shimano Biopace and Osymetric chainrings are examples of non-round chainrings. Currently, this calculator only works on ellipse chainrings.

## Ovality
*Ovality* is the % difference between the longest (`a`) and shortest (`b`) sections of the radius of the oval. For example, a chainring with 10% ovality could have a radius of 50mm at the widest part, and a radius of 45mm at the narrowest part.

## How?
When looking at oval chainrings, we know the circumfrance (the number of teeth the chainring has), and the ovality (how "squished" the oval is). Using this info, we can calculate the maximum and minimum radius lengths.
